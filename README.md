# Chang'e 1 simulation
Actual goal of this project is to create a controlable simulation of a Chinese Moon-exploring mission Chang'e 1.

However there are a lot of extra stuff, so feel free to use it as a space sandbox

## Controls
```LMB``` - spawn a planet (hold to launch)

```RMB``` - navigate

```Scroll Up/Down``` - zoom in/out (currently zooms to initial center)

```Spacebar``` - stop/start simulation (starts simulation back at ```BASE_SPEED```)

```Arrow Up/Down/Left/Right``` - control rocket
