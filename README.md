# Chang'e 1 simulation 🚀
Actual goal of this project is to create a controlable simulation of a Chinese Moon-exploring mission Chang'e 1.

However there are a lot of extra stuff, so feel free to use it as a space simulation sandbox kinda :)

## Controls 🎮
`LMB` - Spawn a planet (hold to launch)

`RMB` - Navigate

`S` - Snap back to initial center

`Scroll Up/Down` - Zoom in/out (currently zooms to initial center)

`Spacebar` - Stop/start simulation (continues simulation at `BASE_SPEED`)

`Arrow Up/Down/Left/Right` - control rocket
### Changing LMB mode 🕹️
`L` - Launch mode

`I` - Information mode
